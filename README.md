# 🚨 Wearable GPS Tracker (Simulation)

A Java-based simulation of wearable GPS tracking for disaster management scenarios. Simulates real-time location monitoring for maritime workers like fishermen using wearable devices.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- Real-time GPS position logging (simulated data)
- Modular OOP design with clear separation of concerns
- Device simulation for wearables (watches/pins/shirts)
- Extensible architecture for additional features
